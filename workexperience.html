  <h3>Personal Website</h3>
  <p>I built a personal website that introduces who I am, showcases my experience, and links to my projects and contact information. It serves as a digital space to present my work and growth in IT so far.</p>
  <p>&nbsp</p>
  
  <h3>Virtrail – Accommodation Booking Website</h3>
  <p>Virtrail is a booking site concept I created where users can book accommodations. It’s not a real service, but it was designed for learning how to structure responsive layouts, use forms, and plan a user-friendly interface.</p>
  <p>&nbsp</p>

  <h3>2D Godot Game</h3>

  <p>&nbsp</p>

  <h3>ConsoleApp – C# Console Application</h3>
  <p>This was one of my early projects where I built a console-based program in C#. It helped me learn about inputs, loops, conditionals, and how to break logic down into methods.</p>
